# Hack The Box colorscheme for IdaPro
Tried to use the official colors from https://www.hackthebox.com/docs/Hack_The_Box_Brand_Assets_Guide.pdf however had to add additional colors to make it work.

# Installation:
1. Go to Ida installation directory and the subdirectory "themes".
2. Create directory called "htb"
3. Place theme "theme.css" in this folder.
4. Pick the theme in the "Colors" dialog.
